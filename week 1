Why Some Developers Avoid Facades

Some developers prefer Dependency Injection (DI) over facades because:

✅ Explicit Dependencies: With DI, you can see exactly what dependencies a class requires.
✅ Easier to Swap Implementations: If you ever need to replace a service, DI makes it easier.
✅ Better for Testing: DI makes it easier to mock services without relying on Laravel’s
  facade testing utilities.
